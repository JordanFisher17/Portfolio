# Portfolio
A Github Repository demonstrating my Developer Portfolio


1. Secure Notes
   
    The source code contained within this file group is that used to create a basic Android Application using the programming languages Kotlin and Java.
    This project was an early creation, created as a final piece of work for a short Computer Science course undertaken before enrolling on my MSc Computer
    Science with Artificial Intelligence. This file involved a great deal of self learning as the particular course undertaken, did not in fact teach
    Kotlin or Java languages and instead focused on Web Application development using Python, HTML and CSS. 
    
    
3. Finance
   
    This file contains the Source Code for a Web Application written in Python, HTML and CSS, completed as part of a Computer Science course.
    With the exception of helpers.py and apology.html which were provided by the course facilitators, the Source Code files were created by myself.
    The Web Application works by using an API Key in order to draw financial market data from IEX so that this can be used in order to simulate a Web Application for the building of a Stock Portfolio. This allows the users to purchase, sell  and build a fictional portfolio of Stocks which are stored 
    using a SQL Databased using SQLite3.


5. Graphical User Interface
   
   The source code contained within this directory demonstrates part of my contribution to a larger project. As part of this project I was tasked to work with a Object Orientated Model in order to create a popular puzzle game. Part of my role within this project was to create the Graphical User Interface for this game which would interact with the model itself utilising the model-view-controller paradym. Further to this, I was also resonsible for the development and execusion of a test plan for this overall project which used a combination of manual and unit testing using J-Unit. Whilst I worked on other classes within the model, only those completed entirely by me have been uploaded.
